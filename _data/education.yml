- degree: B.Sc. in Cognitive Science
  uni: University of Linköping
  year: 2015 &mdash; 2018
  summary: Cognitive Science is a multidisciplinary science and gives the learner a holistic view by studying subjects ranging from UX design, programming, AI, hu-man factors and behavioural psychology. At university, I focused my time and talent on programming and joined the robotics clubs, where I programmed robot’s movement and the NLP engine in their speech recognition.<br>My bachelor essay was about the differences that exist in communication with a chatbot vs. a hu-man. I built a chatbot using Chatscript and made a study where people had to find differences in two pictures by cooperating with first a human and then a chatbot. The differences I measured were boredom, frustration, and repetition they made with the two conditions (chatbot and human). With a thematic analysis, more differences also presented themselves.
