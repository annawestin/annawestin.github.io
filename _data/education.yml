  uni: University of Linköping
  year: 2015 &mdash; 2018
  summary: Cognitive Science is a multidisciplinary science, and gives the learner a holistic view by studying subjects ranging from UX design, programming, AI, human factors and behavioural psychology. At university, I focused my time and talent to programming and joined the robotics clubs, where I programmed robot’s movement and the NLP engine in their speech recognition.<br>My bachelor essay was about the differences that exist in a communication with a chatbot vs a human. I built a chatbot using Chatscript and made a study where people had to find differences in two pictures by cooperating with first a human and then a chatbot. The differences I measured was boredom, frustration, and repetition they made with the two conditions (chatbot and human). With a tematic analysis more differences also presented themselves.
