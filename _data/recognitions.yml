  summary: Made a study on 118 participants that investigated three gender-related effects on the rated persuasiveness of a speech given by a humanoid robot. It examined (1) the female or male gendered voice and visual appearance of the robot, (2) the female or male gender of the participant, and (3) the interaction between robot gender and participant gender. The study employed a measure of persuasiveness based on the Aristotelian modes of persuasion; ethos, pathos and logos. In contrast to previous studies on gender bias toward intelligent virtual agents and robots, the gender of the robot did not influence the rated persuasiveness of the speech, and female participants rated the speech as more persuasive than men overall.
