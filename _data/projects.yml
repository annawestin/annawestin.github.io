  description: Participated in the full weekend Hackathon in Linköping. The goal was for each team to create a new product by using open source API. Me and my team built a Rasberry prototype of a pill box that was connected to a website and an app, and that through the API 46ELKS sent text messages to the user and the user's family in case she/he forgot to take their medicine. My work in this project consisted of creating the app through Android Studio.
