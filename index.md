### Hello,

I'm 27 years old and currently live in Stockholm, Sweden. I have a bachelors degree in Cognitive science, which is a multidisciplinary science. This includes subject ranging from UX design, programming and language technology to human factors and behavioral psychology. However, I learned most of my programming from working on side-projects with robots and from my work with the company RISE SICS East.

My free time is spent on side-projects, but also on, when I get the chance, traveling and diving. I just got home from Tanzania where I climbed Kilimanjaro and snorkeled a bit, and now I’m looking to work for a company with exciting projects. I’m social and work well in groups. The best cooperation in a group I had was when me and a group of students made a SMART door where we weren’t allowed to have any leaders of the group. This I tried to apply to other group projects, but it didn’t go as well. I learned some people need a leader to give them assignments to do, which work for me too, but I have no problems with the leader role also being a cooperation in the group. I work just as well on my own, but I also prefer to have at least someone I can bounce ideas around with.

Most of the time I’m happy and not nearly as funny as I wish I was. The leisure projects I done more recently has been around Natural Language Processing and UX design. Some of these projects will propobly come up soon on the website.

## Education
**B.Sc. in Cognitive Science**, Linköping University, 2015&ndash;2018

My bachelor essay was about the differences that exist in a communication with a chatbot vs a human. I built a chatbot using Chatscript and then made a study where people had to find differences in two pictures by cooperating with first a human and then a chatbot. The differences I measured was boredom, frustration, and repetition they made with the two conditions (chatbot and human). I also made a tematic analysis and found some more differences.

**Japanese**, Yoshida Institute, Tokyo, 2013&ndash;2014

**Media and Communication**, Röda Korsets Folkhögskola, 2010&ndash;2011

I went to South Africa and made a short documentary about White Sangomas, which was shown in the cinema for one day in Stockholm.

## Experience
#### Work
**Web Development & Research assistant** (Summer internship), [RISE SICS East](https://www.sics.se/), 2018

Internship focused on optimizing the synonym generator on the website [TeCST](https://www.ida.liu.se/projects/scream/webapp/). The website is made for web editors to write texts that are easier to understand to facilitate for people with reading disabilities. The website uses language technology that tells you how hard the text is to read, and give the writer hints on how to make the text easier. My work this summer consisted of:
* Researching on different methods to generate synonyms.
* Evaluating the method found by creating an online survey.
* Write a report on the work.

**Web Development** (Summer internship), [RISE SICS East](https://www.sics.se/), 2017

Internship focused on continuing to develop on the website TeCST.  My work for the summer consisted of:
* Implementing a Text-to-Speech function on the website.
* UX design.
* Frontend development.

**Web Development & Research assistant** (Part time), [RISE SICS East](https://www.sics.se/), 2017&ndash;2018

The part time work focused on continuing to develop on the website earlier mentioned (TeCST). My work consisted of:
* Creating a new synonym lexicon.
* Make the language technology information of the texts more user friendly for the writers (UX design).

**Registrator and Post manager** (Full time), Proffice, 2012

My work for Proffice was during the period when the new law was about to take effect of teachers having to have a teacher's license to teach. My work consisted of:
* Taking care of the registration of teacher licenses from both Swedish and foreign applications.
* Make sure that the mail comes in and out as it should. 
* Digitally sort out the applications to different specialization groups
once they have entered the database after being registered.


#### Side projects

**RoboCup German Open**, 2018

Participated in the RoboCup@Home League with the team LiU@HomeWreckers. The robot used was the Softbank robot Pepper that through automation had to solve tasks in a staged up home. My responsibility was the Natural Language Processing of the robot. **[**[News article](https://www.nyteknik.se/ingenjorskarriar/vm-vilken-ar-den-basta-hemroboten-6909132)**]**

**SMART Door/Digital receptionist**, 2017

Built a prototype of a SMART door that recognized people, socialized with them, and could book a meeting into Google calender by voice control. I programmed the doors face recognition, chatbot, natural language processing, and Text-to-Speech. 
**[**[News article](http://www.nt.se/nyheter/norrkoping/de-byggde-en-smart-entr-om5255501.aspx)**]**


**Talang**, 2017

Participated in the swedish TV show *Talang* (the Swedish equivalent of America's Got Talent) along with a team of students from University of Linköping. The robots used was Sofbank's Nao Next Gen. We qualified for the semi-finals during our audition.

#### Publications

**He is not more persuasive than her: No gender biases toward robots giving speeches**, 2018

Made a study on 118 participants that investigated three gender-related effects on the rated persuasiveness of a speech given by a humanoid robot: (1) the female or male gendered voice and visual appearance of the robot, (2) the female or male gender of the participant, and (3) the interaction between robot gender and participant gender. The study employed a measure of persuasiveness based on the Aristotelian modes of persuasion: ethos, pathos and logos. In contrast to previous studies on gender bias toward intelligent virtual agents and robots, the gender of the robot did not influence the rated persuasiveness of the speech, and female participants rated the speech as more persuasive than men overall.
